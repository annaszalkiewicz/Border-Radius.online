# Border-Radius Generator
[Border-Radius.online](https://border-radius.online) is an Online CSS3 Border-Radius Generator Web Application built for lazy Web Developers, just like you! â˜•

## Getting Started
I kept this project as simple as it could be; No Libraries, No Frameworks, No Tools, nothing more than Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript, so there is nothing impressing on how to use/install it:

- `git clone https://github.com/elharony/Border-Radius.online.git`
- `cd Border-Radius.online`
- Open the `index.html` directly, or use A Live Previewer to make it easier to modify the App!

> Here is the [Live Version of Border-Radius.online](https://border-radius.online) ðŸ¤–
